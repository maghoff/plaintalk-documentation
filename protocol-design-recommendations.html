<p>
Based on the <a href="introduction-and-definition.html">definition of PlainTalk</a>, we now
have a workable syntax for message and field framing. This document gives some recommendations
for what to put in those messages.
</p>

<h1>Do: support asynchronous message passing</h1>

<p>Don't implement remote procedure calls (RPC). The difference between message passing and
RPC is that operations in RPC are blocking while message passing allows multiple operations
to be interleaved.
</p>

<p>
To support a request and response-style protocol with asynchronous message passing, use the first
field of every request as an identifier. The response then uses the same identifier, allowing
responses to arrive out of order and be understood in connection to the corresponding request:
</p>

<pre class="plaintalk">
<span class="message to-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">define</span> <span class="field">war</span></span>
<span class="message to-server"><span class="field">1</span> <span class="field">define</span> <span class="field">freedom</span></span>
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">1</span> <span class="field">ok</span> <span class="field">freedom<span class="control">{1}</span> is<span class="control">{1}</span> slavery</span></span>
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">ok</span> <span class="field">war<span class="control">{1}</span> is<span class="control">{1}</span> peace</span></span>
</pre>

<p>
A good format for the responses is <code>&lt;message-id&gt;</code>, then either <code>ok</code>
or <code>error</code>. <code>ok</code> can be followed by whatever makes sense as the response
for the request. <code>error</code> can be more standardized, with for example one field
containing an error identifier (keep it human readable) an another field with a human readable
description of the error situation.
</p>

<p>
As an implementation concern it is worth noting that many protocols will likely handle messages
mostly, or even completely, in order. It is then a good assumption that responses will arrive mostly in
the same order as the requests were sent, making <i>deque</i> a good data structure for linking
the responses to the correct request.
</p>

<p>
<b>Do: Reserve an identifier</b> to be used for server-initiated events, for example <code>*</code>.
Let's pretend user "mag" is joining a chat room:
</p>

<pre class="plaintalk">
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">*</span> <span class="field">join</span> <span class="field">mag</span></span>
</pre>

<p>
With this basic structure, events can be sent by the server and handled by the client even when a
long-running operation is in progress.
</p>

<p>
Consider having the "result" of a request arrive as server-initiated events as an alternative to
including everything in the <code>ok</code> response. This can be easier for transmitting lists of
things, for example.
</p>

<h1>Do: use protocol negotiation</h1>

<p>
Start every connection with a <code>protocol</code> request:
</p>

<pre class="plaintalk">
<span class="message to-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">protocol</span> <span class="field">chat</span> <span class="field">reactions</span></span>
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">ok</span> <span class="field">chat</span> <span class="field">stickers</span></span>
</pre>

<p>
In the above exchange we see that the client first declares his supported protocol features to be
"chat" and "reactions". The server responds with its entire list of supported features, in this
case "chat" and "stickers". The negotiated protocol after this exchange is the intersection of
features in both lists, namely just "chat" in this case.
</p>

<p>
Since the server responds with its entire list of supported features regardless of what the client
sends, we can save half a roundtrip time by having both the server and the client declare their
protocol support up front:
</p>

<pre class="plaintalk">
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">*</span> <span class="field">protocol</span> <span class="field">chat</span> <span class="field">stickers</span></span>
<span class="message to-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">protocol</span> <span class="field">chat</span> <span class="field">reactions</span></span>
<span class="message from-server"><span class="field">0</span> <span class="field">ok</span></span>
</pre>

<p>
<b>Do: Negotiate features</b>, not versions. It is easier to evolve the protocol to drop obsolete
features this way. A feature in this list could include sets of available commands or maybe fixes
to pre-existing features.
